<p>For my capstone course project in college, I specifically worked on a small team to develop a travel booking system 
for KPMG. We used ASP.Net, C#, and SQL Server to design, plan, and develop a way for employees to search for and book a
flight, car, hotel, train, or a bundle package. We also added the functionality to log in as an employee or intern, manage 
user profile, view reservation history, export reservation history to Excel, and email the itinerary and confirmation message. 
The most rewarding part of developing this system was being able to utilize my problem solving skills once the requirements 
were identified and also seeing the customer oriented solutions and results. I enjoyed being able to docuement the client's requirements.
In this project, the client was KPMG. We interviewed the client to gather requirements and ask questions about design and functionality.
After defining requirements, we began our planning phase. We documented a UML Diagram, ERD Diagram, Use Case Scenarios, Use Case Diagrams,
and a storyboard. After continuously refining our plan and frequent follow ups with the client, we developed the user interface using ASP.NET. 
Next we added in the functionality and operation using C# and we connected the system to the database that we created from scratch. I had a hand 
in all aspects of the planing and development of the system. Myself and one other team member were in charge of the back-end
system development an database desgin and managaement. The most challenging part of this project was managing scope creep. Overrall I truly
enjoyed developing this project. It was fun, challenging, and allowed me to put my problem solving skills into major action. Our professor 
loved our system and our system was actually one of the few top ranked in the course section.</p>

      <p> This page allows the user to view their profile information. Their information was pulled from the database and automatically populated based on who the user was.
      The user could also modify their information and then save it back to the database. The user could also manage their reward points.

      <!--Flight-->

      <p>This page allows the user to search for a flight. The user inputs their search criteria and then clicks the button. Input validation is included for the input and will show error messages.Once the user
      clicks search, the system will show a list of all active flights based on the user's search criteria.</p>
       <br><br><br><br>
      
      
      <!--Hotel-->

      <p>The user can also search for a hotel. The process is similar to searching for a flight.</p>
       <br><br><br>
      
      <!--Car-->
      <img src="/Photos/Screen Shot 2016-04-05 at 8.29.06 PM.png" width="600" height = "500" alt = "" align=left /><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
       <p>The user can also search for a car. The process is similar to searching for a flight.</p>
        <br><br><br><br><br><br>
      
      <!--Train-->
 <img src="/Photos/Screen Shot 2016-04-05 at 8.29.16 PM.png" width="600" height = "500" alt = "" align=left /><br><br><br><br>
  <p>The user can also search for a train. The process is similar to searching for a flight.</p>
      
      <!--Itinerary-->
 <img src="/Photos/Screen Shot 2016-04-05 at 8.29.30 PM.png" width="600" height = "500" alt = "" align=left />
 <p>Once the user searches for a flight, hotel, car, or train, they can select and book it. The user can add other bookings to be part of a bundle
 deal. This page shows the user's itinerary. For screenshot purposes, I did not book any travel, so it says that I do not have any trips planned. Once the
 user books travel, it will show up on this page. Also, a copy of the itinerary will be automatically sent to the user's email upon booking.</p>
