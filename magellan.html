<p>For my capstone course project in college, I specifically worked on a small team to develop a travel booking system 
for KPMG. We used ASP.Net, C#, and SQL Server to design, plan, and develop a way for employees to search for and book a
flight, car, hotel, train, or a bundle package. We also added the functionality to log in as an employee or intern, manage 
user profile, view reservation history, export reservation history to Excel, and email the itinerary and confirmation message. 
The most rewarding part of developing this system was being able to utilize my problem solving skills once the requirements 
were identified and also seeing the customer oriented solutions and results. I enjoyed being able to docuement the client's requirements.
In this project, the client was KPMG. We interviewed the client to gather requirements and ask questions about design and functionality.
After defining requirements, we began our planning phase. We documented a UML Diagram, ERD Diagram, Use Case Scenarios, Use Case Diagrams,
and a storyboard. After continuously refining our plan and frequent follow ups with the client, we developed the user interface using ASP.NET. 
Next we added in the functionality and operation using C# and we connected the system to the database that we created from scratch. I had a hand 
in all aspects of the planing and development of the system. Myself and one other team member were in charge of the back-end
system development an database desgin and managaement. The most challenging part of this project was managing scope creep. Overrall I truly
enjoyed developing this project. It was fun, challenging, and allowed me to put my problem solving skills into major action. Our professor 
loved our system and our system was actually one of the few top ranked in the course section.</p>

      <p> This page allows the user to view their profile information. Their information was pulled from the database and automatically populated based on who the user was.
      The user could also modify their information and then save it back to the database. The user could also manage their reward points.
