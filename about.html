<a id="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Here's My Story</h3>

<p> Hello again! I graduated from James Madison University in May 2015 with a degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS).
Right out of college, I immediately landed an IT Risk Advisory Consulting job at one of the big four accounting firms, EY. 
Although, I started my career in this position, I know that my heart and brain were originally wired to create, build, develop, and solve problems.
I am currently looking for a job that will allow me to gain experience in front-end and back end development. I want to create beautiful and useful websites and 
applications that make everyone's lives easier. In the meantime, I will continue to expand my programming skills with learning Ruby on 
Rails, HTML, and CSS using Codeacademy and Github. I am most comfortable with ASP.NET and C# but I am eager to challenge myself and grow my skill set with learning new languages.
In my free time, I practice my coding, design websites and graphic flyers for friends and for my sorority, Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc., read, workout, and try new recipes.
I have been involved with organizations such as Women Who Code DC, Women in Technology (WIT), Association of Information Technology Professionals (AITP), and Technology Student Association (TSA).
I am hoping to attend my first Hackathon very soon! 
 </p>
